# Eth2CNC"
This project is a fork of the rt-8p8c project.
Instead of an PIC32 I want to use a STM32F407VG.

I want to try to realize at least 9 stepper motors and these things for 3D-printers like heatbed, extruder heaters and so on.


The goal is to use this board with linuxcnc for a mill over ethernet and use it with USB to print with a 3D printer.
